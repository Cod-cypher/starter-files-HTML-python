This is a really simple HTML,CSS and JavaScript file creator.

WHY I CREATED IT.

I was tired of always creating index.html, style.css and script.js , everytime I wanted to learn something or creating something new regarding 
Web Development so thats why i made this.

HOW IT WORKS.

Its a simple python script that creates a index.html ,style.css and script.css file with some boiler plate code in each file like using strict mode in 
JavaScript and some default styling in style.css. Just run the script or use the installer and specify a directory in which you want the files to be
located.
